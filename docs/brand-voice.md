# How to Use Brand Voice Settings in Hi, Moose

## What This Helps You Do

Brand Voice Settings let you customize how AI-generated content sounds—ensuring every content brief, AEO analysis, versus page, or metadata suggestion reflects your brand's unique voice, tone, and terminology.

You define your brand's personality (tone, style, audience), upload brand guidelines or sample content, and Hi, Moose uses this context whenever it generates text. This means you spend less time editing AI output to sound "like you"—the AI learns your voice upfront.

Think of it as a style guide for the AI: What words to use, what to avoid, and how to write for your specific audience.

---

## When to Use This

- **Brand consistency**: Ensure all AI-generated content (content briefs, meta descriptions, comparison intros) uses the same tone and terminology.
- **Industry-specific language**: Train the AI to use technical terms, jargon, or preferred phrasing unique to your industry.
- **Avoid generic copy**: Stop AI from using clichés or overused marketing phrases that don't fit your brand.
- **Team alignment**: Give your team (and the AI) a shared reference for how content should sound.
- **Onboarding**: Upload existing brand guidelines (PDFs, docs, or web pages) so the AI learns from your established voice.

Use this **before** generating content at scale—it's easier to set your voice once than edit 50 things later.

## Step-by-Step (in Hi, Moose)

### 1. Access Brand Voice Settings

1. Open your project.
2. In the left sidebar, click **Brand Voice Settings** (under project tools).

You'll see three main sections:
- **Basic Brand Information** (required)
- **Voice & Tone Preferences** (optional)
- **Brand Documents** (optional)

---

### 2. Add Basic Brand Information

**Why this matters**: Your brand name and website are used across all AI features—especially in content generation and competitor analysis.

#### How to Fill It Out

1. In the **Basic Brand Information** section:
   - **Brand Name** (required): Enter your company or product name (e.g., "Acme Corp").
   - **Primary Website** (required): Enter your main website URL (e.g., "https://acmecorp.com").

2. Click **Save Brand Information**.

**If you see red error messages**: Both fields are required. Fill them in before saving.

**Where this is used**:
- Content Brief Creator (mentions your brand in competitor analysis).
- Versus Content Wizard (adds your brand to comparisons).
- AEO Tools (references your brand when analyzing content).
- FAQ Generator / Audience Questions
- Key Points Generator

---

### 3. Define Voice & Tone Preferences

**Why this matters**: These fields teach the AI how to write for your brand. The more specific you are, the better the AI matches your style.

#### Voice Fields Explained

1. **Brand Tone** (optional):
   - How your brand sounds in general (e.g., "Friendly and approachable," "Professional and authoritative").
   - Examples: "Casual and conversational," "Data-driven and analytical," "Empathetic and supportive."

2. **Writing Style** (optional):
   - Your preferred content structure (e.g., "Conversational," "Technical," "Story-driven").
   - Examples: "Short sentences with bullet points," "Long-form narrative," "FAQ-style explanations."

3. **Target Audience** (optional):
   - Who you're writing for (e.g., "Small business owners," "Technical professionals," "SaaS marketers").
   - Include their knowledge level: "Beginners," "Intermediate," "Expert."

4. **Brand Values** (optional):
   - Core principles your brand stands for (e.g., "Innovation, Sustainability, Transparency").
   - The AI will subtly weave these into content (e.g., emphasizing transparency in trust-building copy).

5. **Preferred Terminology** (optional):
   - Words, phrases, or product names you prefer (e.g., "Use 'customers,' not 'users'").
   - Industry-specific terms (e.g., "AI engine optimization (AEO)," not "AI search optimization").

6. **Terminology to Avoid** (optional):
   - Words or phrases to never use (e.g., "Avoid 'cheap,' use 'affordable' instead").
   - Overused marketing jargon (e.g., "Don't use 'synergy,' 'disruptive,' or 'game-changer'").

7. **Example Content** (optional):
   - Paste 1-2 paragraphs of your best content that exemplifies your voice.
   - The AI learns tone, sentence structure, and style from these examples.

#### How to Save

1. Fill in any or all of the fields above.
2. Scroll down and click **Save Voice Settings**.
3. You'll see a success message: "Brand voice settings saved successfully."

**Can I skip these fields?** Yes. They're optional—but the more you fill in, the more on-brand the AI's output will be.

---

### 4. Upload Brand Documents

**Why this matters**: Documents (brand guidelines, marketing materials, sample blog posts) give the AI deeper context—especially for complex brand voices or niche industries.

#### Upload Files

**Supported formats**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, MD (Max 10MB per file).

1. In the **Brand Documents** section, click **Select Files** under "Upload Files."
2. Choose up to 5 files from your computer.
3. Hi, Moose uploads and extracts text from each file.
4. You'll see the file listed with its name and size (e.g., "Brand_Guidelines.pdf, 2.3 KB").

**What happens to the file?**
- Hi, Moose extracts the text content.
- Hi, Moose AI summarizes key points (tone, terminology, style).
- The file contents are stored securely—only you and your team can access.

**Limits**: You can upload **up to 5 files**. If you reach the limit, delete an existing file before adding a new one.

#### Add URLs

**Use this for**: Blog posts, landing pages, about pages, or any public content that showcases your voice.

1. In the **Add URL** section:
   - Paste a URL (e.g., "https://acmecorp.com/about").
   - Click **Add URL**.

2. Hi, Moose fetches the page content, extracts text, and saves it as a document.

3. The URL appears in your document list with a purple link icon (e.g., "About Us - Acme Corp").

**What's extracted**:
- Headings, paragraphs, and body text.
- Alt text from images (if relevant).
- Meta descriptions (for context).

**Limits**: You can add **up to 5 URLs**. If you hit the limit, delete an existing URL document before adding a new one.

---

### 5. Manage Your Documents

Once files or URLs are added, you'll see them in the **Your Documents** section.

#### View Documents

Each document shows:
- **Name**: File name or page title.
- **Source icon**: Blue (file) or purple (URL).
- **Size**: File size (for uploads) or "Web content" (for URLs).

#### Delete Documents

1. Click the **trash icon** next to any document.
2. A modal appears: "Are you sure you want to delete [Document Name]?"
3. Click **Delete** to confirm.

The document is removed from your brand voice context immediately.

**Why delete?** If a document is outdated, off-brand, or no longer relevant, remove it so the AI doesn't learn from it.

---

## What You Get (Outputs)

After configuring Brand Voice Settings, you have:

- **Consistent AI output**: All AI-generated content (content briefs, meta descriptions, comparison intros) uses your brand's tone, style, and preferred terminology.
- **Less editing**: AI output is closer to publication-ready because it already sounds like your brand.
- **Team alignment**: Everyone on your team generates content with the same voice—no more inconsistent messaging.
- **Scalable content**: Generate 50+ pieces of content knowing they'll all sound cohesive.

Your settings apply **automatically** to:
- Content Brief Creator
- AEO Tools (metadata suggestions)
- Versus Content Wizard (comparison intros/conclusions)
- Webflow Content Manager (AI suggestions)
- Any feature with AI-generated text

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with Brand Tone and Audience**: These two fields have the biggest impact. Be specific—"Friendly and approachable for small business owners" is better than just "Friendly."

2. **Use real examples**: In the "Example Content" field, paste actual paragraphs from your best blog posts or landing pages. The AI learns better from real content than hypothetical descriptions.

3. **Be explicit about terminology**: If you have industry-specific terms, list them in "Preferred Terminology." Example: "Use 'programmatic SEO,' not 'pSEO.'"

4. **Upload your brand guide first**: If you have a PDF brand guide, upload it before filling out the text fields. Hi, Moose can extract tone/terminology from the document, saving you time.

5. **Avoid contradictions**: Don't say "Professional and formal" in Brand Tone, then upload a document with casual, conversational writing. Pick one voice and stick to it.

6. **Update regularly**: If your brand voice evolves, update these settings. Old guidelines = off-brand AI output.

7. **Test after saving**: Generate a content brief or AEO analysis after updating your voice settings to see if the AI matches your expectations. Tweak as needed.

8. **Less is more for documents**: Don't upload 5 random blog posts. Upload your **best** content—the pieces that most clearly represent your voice.

9. **Use "Avoid Terminology" liberally**: If you hate certain words (e.g., "leverage," "synergy," "thought leader"), list them. The AI will actively avoid them.

10. **Team collaboration**: If you have a copywriter or brand manager, have them fill out Brand Voice Settings. They know your voice best.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. "Brand name is required" error when saving

**Why**: The Brand Name field is empty or wasn't filled in.

**Fix**:
- In the **Basic Brand Information** section, fill in the **Brand Name** field.
- Click **Save Brand Information** (not "Save Voice Settings").
- Both Brand Name and Primary Website are required—fill in both before saving.

---

### 2. File upload fails—"File too large" error

**Why**: Your file exceeds the 10MB limit.

**Fix**:
- Check the file size (right-click → Properties in Windows, or Get Info in macOS).
- If over 10MB, try:
  - Compressing the PDF (use a tool like Adobe Acrobat or Smallpdf).
  - Splitting the document into smaller files.
  - Extracting key sections and uploading only those.

---

### 3. URL processing fails—"Failed to fetch content"

**Why**: The URL is behind a paywall, requires login, or blocks web crawlers.

**Fix**:
- Make sure the URL is **publicly accessible** (open it in an incognito/private browser window to test).
- Try a different URL (e.g., your About page instead of a gated resource).
- If it's behind a login, download the page as a PDF and upload the file instead.

---

### 4. AI still doesn't match my brand voice

**Why**: The settings are too vague, or you haven't uploaded enough examples.

**Fix**:
- **Be more specific**: Instead of "Friendly," write "Friendly and approachable, like talking to a colleague over coffee."
- **Add example content**: Paste 2-3 paragraphs of your best content in the "Example Content" field.
- **Upload brand guidelines**: If you have a PDF brand guide, upload it—the AI learns better from documents.
- **Use "Preferred Terminology"**: List 5-10 words/phrases you use often. This helps the AI pick up your lexicon.

---

### 5. Can't delete a document—trash icon does nothing

**Why**: There's a UI lag, or the document is already being deleted.

**Fix**:
- Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R).
- Try clicking the trash icon again.
- If the issue persists, log out and log back in.
- Check if the document is already gone—the list may not have updated yet.

---

### 6. "Upgrade to access Brand Voice Settings" message appears

**Why**: You're on the Free plan. Brand Voice Settings require a paid subscription.

**Fix**:
- Click **Upgrade Now** to see plan options.
- Choose a plan to unlock this feature.
- Once upgraded, refresh the page and Brand Voice Settings will be accessible.

---

### 7. Uploaded document shows "Processing..." forever

**Why**: The file is large, corrupted, or Hi, Moose couldn't extract text.

**Fix**:
- Wait 60 seconds—large files can take time.
- If still processing after 2 minutes, refresh the page.
- If the document disappeared, try uploading again.
- If it's a scanned PDF (images, not text), Hi, Moose may fail to extract content. Convert it to a text-based PDF first using OCR (e.g., Adobe Acrobat).

---

### 8. Brand Voice Settings don't apply to old content

**Why**: Brand Voice Settings only affect **new** AI generations—not previously generated content.

**Fix**:
- Regenerate old content (e.g., re-run Content Brief Generator, regenerate versus pages).
- Edit old content manually to match your new voice.
- Brand Voice Settings are **forward-looking**—they don't retroactively update existing outputs.

---

### 9. Team members can't see my Brand Voice Settings

**Why**: Brand Voice Settings are **project-specific**, but all team members with access to the project should see them.

**Fix**:
- Make sure team members are added to the project (not just the team).
- If they still can't see settings, they may lack the right permissions—check team roles in Admin Dashboard.
- Only **Owners** and **Members** can edit Brand Voice Settings. **Viewers** can only view (if at all).

---

### 10. AI ignores "Terminology to Avoid" field

**Why**: The AI may not have strong enough instructions, or the term is contextually necessary.

**Fix**:
- Be more explicit: Instead of "Avoid 'cheap,'" write "Never use 'cheap.' Always use 'affordable' or 'budget-friendly' instead."
- Add the unwanted term to **both** "Terminology to Avoid" **and** "Preferred Terminology" (with alternatives). Example:
  - Avoid: "Leverage"
  - Preferred: "Use 'use,' 'apply,' or 'implement' instead of 'leverage.'"

---

### Can I have different Brand Voice Settings for different projects?

Switch projects to use different voices.

---

### How many documents can I upload?

- **5 files** (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, MD) — Max 10MB each.
- **5 URLs** (web pages, blog posts, landing pages).

**Total**: 10 documents (5 files + 5 URLs).

- **URLs** are fetched once and stored as extracted text (not re-fetched every time).
- Only you and your team members (with project access) can view or delete documents.

---

### Can the AI read images in my PDF?

No. Hi, Moose extracts **text only** from PDFs. If your PDF contains:
- **Text-based content**: ✅ Works fine.
- **Scanned images**: ❌ Won't be extracted (use OCR to convert first).
- **Charts/graphics**: ❌ Ignored (text in captions may be extracted).

For best results, use text-based PDFs, not scanned documents.

---

### Does uploading brand guidelines train the AI permanently?

No. Brand Voice Settings are **project context**, not model training.

The AI uses your guidelines as **instructions** for this project only. It doesn't learn globally or affect other users' experiences.

Think of it like giving the AI a cheat sheet—it references your guidelines each time it generates content, but doesn't "memorize" them forever.

---

### How long does it take for settings to apply?

**Immediately**. Once you click **Save Voice Settings** or **Save Brand Information**, the changes are saved and used in the next AI generation.

You don't need to wait, refresh, or restart—just generate content and your voice will be applied.

---

### Can I export my Brand Voice Settings?

Sorry, not currently. Brand Voice Settings are stored and tied to your project.

**Workaround**: Copy/paste the text fields into a document for your records, or take screenshots.

---

### What if my brand voice changes over time?

Just update the settings:
1. Go to **Brand Voice Settings**.
2. Edit the fields that changed.
3. Upload new documents or delete outdated ones.
4. Click **Save Voice Settings**.

All future AI generations will use the updated voice. Old content isn't retroactively changed.

---

### Do team members see the same Brand Voice Settings?

Yes. Brand Voice Settings are **shared** across all team members with access to the project.

**Editing permissions**:
- **Owner**: Full edit access.
- **Members**: Full edit access (in most cases).

---

### Can I use Brand Voice Settings on the Free plan?

No. Brand Voice Settings require a paid subscription.

Free users see an upgrade prompt. Upgrade to unlock this feature.

---

### What if I delete a document by accident?

**Files**: Permanently deleted from storage. You'll need to re-upload.

**URLs**: Deleted from your project, but you can re-add the URL anytime (Hi, Moose will re-fetch the content).

There's no "undo" for document deletion—be careful when clicking the trash icon.
