# How to Manage Your Team in Hi, Moose

## What this helps you do

Control who has access to your Hi, Moose workspace, invite new team members, and manage existing users. Keep your content creation organized by adding collaborators, removing users who no longer need access, and tracking pending invitations.

## When to use this

- You need to add a new marketer, freelancer, or agency partner to your Hi, Moose account
- Someone left your team and you need to revoke their access
- You want to see who's already on your team and what their role is
- An invitation hasn't been accepted yet and you need to resend it
- You're onboarding multiple team members and need to manage access centrally

## Before you start (requirements)

**You must be the team owner** to access Team Management. If you don't see this section in Settings, you're a team member (not the owner) and can't invite or remove users.

**You need:**
- An active Hi, Moose subscription (team features are plan-dependent)
- The email addresses of people you want to invite
- Confirmation that new members understand they'll receive an invitation email

## Step-by-step (in Hi, Moose)

### To invite a new team member:

1. Go to **Settings** in the main navigation
2. Scroll to the **Team Management** section (owners only)
3. Enter the new member's email address in the invite field (placeholder: `new-teammate@example.com`)
4. Click **Send Invite**
5. The system sends an email invitation to that address
6. The invite appears in your **Pending Invitations** list until they accept

**Why this matters:** Invited users won't have access until they click the link in their email and complete signup. They'll join as team members, not owners.

### To view your current team:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Team Management**
2. Look at the **Team Members** section
3. Each member shows:
   - Their email address
   - Their role badge (owner or member)
   - A **Remove** button (for non-owner members)

**Why this matters:** You can see at a glance who has access to your content, projects, and settings. Only owners can manage the team.

### To remove a team member:

1. Find the member in your **Team Members** list
2. Click **Remove** next to their name (not available for owners)
3. A confirmation modal appears asking if you're sure
4. Review the warning: "Their account will be disabled, and they will no longer be able to log in. All data they created will remain accessible to the team."
5. Click **Remove Member** to confirm, or **Cancel** to abort

**Why this matters:** Removing a member immediately revokes their login access, but their content (projects, documents, etc.) stays with the team. This prevents data loss when people leave.

### To resend a pending invitation:

1. Scroll to the **Pending Invitations** section
2. Find the invite you want to resend (marked with a yellow "Pending" badge)
3. Click **Resend** next to that email
4. The system sends a fresh invitation email

**Why this matters:** Invitation emails can expire or get lost in spam. Resending ensures your new team member gets access without you having to delete and recreate the invite.

## What you get (outputs)

- **Invitation emails:** Sent automatically to new members with a signup/login link
- **Updated member list:** Real-time view of who's on your team and their roles
- **Pending invites tracking:** See which invitations haven't been accepted yet
- **Team access control:** Ensure only authorized users can access your Hi, Moose workspace
- **Data retention:** All content created by removed members stays accessible to remaining team members

## Tips for best results

- **Invite with a heads-up:** Let people know you're sending an invite so they watch for the email and don't ignore it as spam
- **Use work emails:** Personal email addresses are fine, but work emails make it easier to track who's who in larger teams
- **Remove promptly:** When someone leaves your organization, remove them from Hi, Moose right away to maintain security
- **Check pending regularly:** If an invite sits pending for days, reach out to confirm they received it (or resend)
- **Don't remove yourself:** Owners can't remove themselves—transfer ownership first if needed (contact support)
- **Plan for seat limits:** Some subscription plans have team member limits; check your plan before inviting large groups

## Troubleshooting

### 1. "I don't see the Team Management section"

**Problem:** You're logged in as a team member, not the owner.

**Fix:** Only account owners can manage the team. Ask your team owner to send invites or adjust membership. If you're the account holder but seeing this, contact support—there may be a role assignment issue.

### 2. "The invited person says they never got the email"

**Problem:** Invitation emails sometimes land in spam or get blocked by corporate email filters.

**Fix:**
- Ask them to check spam/junk folders for emails from Hi, Moose or noreply addresses
- Use the **Resend** button in Pending Invitations to send a fresh email
- Try inviting them with a different email address (personal vs. work)
- Confirm the email address was spelled correctly in your original invite

---

### 3. "I can't remove someone from my team"

**Problem:** You're trying to remove the account owner, or you don't have owner permissions yourself.

**Fix:**
- Owners can't be removed via the Remove button—ownership must be transferred first
- Only owners see the Remove button for members
- If you're the owner and the button is missing, refresh the page or contact support

---

### 4. "The person I removed can still log in"

**Problem:** Cached login sessions or browser cookies might persist briefly.

**Fix:**
- Removal disables their account immediately, but they may stay logged in until their session expires (usually within minutes)
- They won't be able to access any data or projects once the session ends
- If they can still access after 15+ minutes, contact support—something may have failed server-side

---

### 5. "I invited someone and now I see two pending invites for them"

**Problem:** You accidentally sent multiple invites to the same email (often by clicking Send Invite twice).

**Fix:**
- This is harmless—both invites go to the same person
- Once they accept one, both will be cleared from your pending list
- Future invites to that email will fail with a message saying they're already on the team

---

### 6. "I removed a team member and now their projects are gone"

**Problem:** You're looking in the wrong place, or there's a display filter hiding their content.

**Fix:**
- All content created by removed members stays in the system—it's not deleted
- Check the **Projects** page and make sure no filters are excluding their work
- Content ownership may not show their name anymore (just "Former Team Member" or similar)
- If content is truly missing, contact support immediately with details of what was lost

## FAQs

**Q: Can I invite someone without an email?**  
No. Team invitations require a valid email address where the invite link will be sent.

**Q: What's the difference between 'owner' and 'member' roles?**  
Owners can manage the team (invite, remove, see billing). Members can use all features but can't change team settings or subscriptions.

**Q: Can I change someone's role from member to owner?**  
Not directly in the UI. Contact support if you need to transfer ownership or add a second owner.

**Q: How many team members can I have?**  
It depends on your subscription plan. Check your plan details in Settings or contact support for your specific limit.

**Q: What happens to content when I remove a member?**  
Their content stays in the system. Projects, documents, and data they created remain accessible to the team. Only their login access is revoked.

**Q: Can I cancel a pending invite?**  
The current UI shows pending invites but doesn't have a "Cancel" button. If you need to revoke an invite before it's accepted, contact support.

**Q: Do removed members get notified?**  
The system doesn't send an automatic "you've been removed" email. They'll discover it when they try to log in and can't. Communicate removals directly if needed for professionalism.

**Q: Can a removed member rejoin later?**  
Yes. You can send them a fresh invitation anytime, and they'll rejoin as a new member. Their old account and data won't be restored—they'll start fresh.
