## Step-by-step (in Hi, Moose)

### 1. Navigate to Content Brief Creator
- Go to **Content Brief Creator** (SEO Mode) or **SEO for AI Content** (Marketer Mode) from your project sidebar

### 2. Enter Your Primary Target Keyword
- In the **"Primary Target Keyword"** field, enter your main SEO keyword. If using Marketer Mode, look for the **What should this content rank for?** field
- Be specific and use natural language (e.g., "how to choose email marketing software" not just "email marketing")
- Use **long-tail keywords** for more targeted briefs

### 3. Select Your Content Template
Choose the template that matches your content goal:
- **Blog Post**: For articles, guides, tutorials, listicles

The template shapes the brief structure and recommendations.

### 4. Choose Your Analysis Depth
- **Speed**: Faster results, analyzes **3 top-ranking URLs** (available on all plans including Free)

  - **Generating brief** (synthesizing all data into structured recommendations)

This typically takes **30-60 seconds** depending on analysis depth.

### 6. Review Your Brief
Once complete, you'll see:
- **Target keyword** and recommended word count

## Troubleshooting

### "You've reached your limit of 5 content briefs this month"
**Solution**: This applies to Free plans. Upgrade to Starter, Growth, or Enterprise for unlimited briefs. Or wait until your monthly limit resets (1st of each month).

### "Depth analysis is available on paid plans"
**Cause**: Free users can only use Speed analysis.  
**Solution**: Upgrade to unlock Depth analysis, which provides more comprehensive data (5+ URLs analyzed, AI Overview citations, more secondary keywords).

### Brief generation stuck at "Crawling competitor content"
**Cause**: Some websites block automated crawling or load slowly.  
**Solution**: Wait up to 90 seconds. If it fails, try again—the system will skip problematic URLs and continue. Speed analysis typically succeeds more reliably than Depth.

### "No AI Overview found for this keyword"
**Explanation**: Not all keywords trigger Google AI Overviews. This is normal and doesn't affect the quality of your brief.  
**Action**: Your brief will still include SerpAPI data, competitor analysis, PAA questions, and ChatGPT Search results.

### Secondary keywords seem off-topic
**Cause**: AI extraction occasionally captures tangential keywords from analyzed content.  
**Solution**: Focus on **high-priority keywords** first—these are most relevant. Use your editorial judgment to filter medium/low priority keywords.

### Recommended word count seems too high/low
**Explanation**: Word count is calculated by averaging the top-ranking competitor pages.  
**Context**: If your competitors have outliers (one 5,000-word guide, others ~1,500 words), the average can skew.  
**Solution**: Check the "Analyzed URLs" section to see individual competitor word counts. Use your judgment based on your content goals and resources. It's not really about reaching a specific word count but instead, your content matching the users' search intent with helpful content. If you can do this in less words, great!

### Brief generation failed with generic error
**Common causes**:
- Temporary service issues
- Invalid or very obscure keywords with no search results
- Network timeouts during URL crawling

**Solutions**:
- Try again in 1-2 minutes (often resolves temporary issues)
- Check your keyword for typos
- Try a more common variation of your keyword first
- Use Speed analysis instead of Depth (fewer potential failure points)

### ChatGPT Search results missing
**Explanation**: ChatGPT Search integration may not return results for all keywords, especially very niche or brand-specific terms.  
**Action**: Your brief is still valuable—it includes search result analysis, competitor crawling, and secondary keywords. ChatGPT Search is supplementary.

### Can't export brief (buttons not working)
**Cause**: Brief generation may still be in progress, or JavaScript error.  
**Solution**: Wait until status shows "Complete" with 100% progress. Refresh the page if needed. If problem persists, try a different browser or clear cache.

## FAQs

### How is this different from just asking ChatGPT to create a content brief?

**Hi, Moose pulls from live data sources that ChatGPT doesn't have access to or often fails to pull:**
- **Real-time Google search results** (ChatGPT's training data has a cutoff date. It may use RAG as need to ground its response however.)
- **Current competitor content** via automated URL crawling (In the basic ChatGPT experience, generally it will not crawl the competing sites already ranking well.)
- **Google AI Overviews** extracted from live SERPs (ChatGPT doesn't know what Google's AI is saying today)
- **People Also Ask questions** from actual SERPs (not predicted)
- **Secondary keywords** extracted from what's actually ranking now (not guessed from training data)

This means you get **current competitive intelligence** and **data-backed recommendations** instead of generic advice based on outdated information.

### What's the difference between Speed and Depth analysis?

| Feature | Speed Analysis | Depth Analysis |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **URLs analyzed** | 3 top-ranking pages | 5+ top-ranking pages |
| **AI Overview citations** | Not crawled | Crawled and analyzed |
| **ChatGPT Search citations** | Limited | More comprehensive |
| **Secondary keywords** | Fewer extracted | More extracted |
| **Generation time** | ~30 seconds | ~60 seconds |
| **Availability** | All plans (including Free) | Paid plans only |
| **Best for** | Quick briefs, low-competition keywords | Competitive analysis, detailed planning |

Choose Speed for faster results or low-competition topics. Choose Depth for competitive keywords where you need maximum insight.

### Can I regenerate a brief with different settings?

Yes. Content briefs are saved to your project, but you can generate a new brief for the same keyword with:
- Different content template (blog → landing page)
- Different analysis depth (Speed → Depth)

This gives you a fresh brief with updated data. Search results change over time, so re-running briefs for evergreen content (quarterly) keeps your strategy current.

### Why does my brief include some URLs marked as "AI Overview Citation" or "ChatGPT Citation"?

These sources come from **Google's AI Overview** or **ChatGPT Search** citations, showing what Google's AI or ChatGPT's web-connected search considers authoritative for your keyword.

**Why this matters**: If Google or ChatGPT cite a source, it's likely perceived as high-quality and relevant. Analyzing these gives you insight into what AI systems prioritize, which can inform your own content strategy.

### How accurate is the recommended word count?

Word count is calculated by averaging the **actual word counts** of top-ranking pages we crawled (not estimated). However:
- Quality matters more than length—don't stuff content to hit a number
- Some niches favor longer content (guides, tutorials), others favor concise answers (definitions, quick how-tos)
- Consider your resources and goals

Use the word count as a **competitive benchmark**, not a strict requirement.

### What if there's no AI Overview for my keyword?

**This is completely normal.** Google AI Overviews don't appear for all searches—typically they show for:
- Informational queries (how-to, what is)
- Complex topics requiring synthesis
- Questions with clear answers

If your keyword doesn't trigger an AI Overview:
- Your brief is still comprehensive (search analysis, competitor crawling, PAA, secondary keywords, ChatGPT Search)
- You may have a better chance of ranking, as there's less SERP competition from AI-generated answers

### Can I use these briefs for my content team or freelancers?

**Absolutely!** That's a primary use case. Export as **PDF** or **DOC** files to share with:
- Freelance writers (gives them data-backed direction)
- Content managers (shows competitive landscape)
- SEO stakeholders (demonstrates research depth)
- Clients (proves strategy is data-driven)

Briefs save time by providing writers with keyword targets, PAA questions to address, competitor benchmarks, and structural recommendations—no additional research needed.

### Does this work for non-English keywords?

Currently, Hi, Moose content briefs are optimized for **English-language keywords**. While you can try other languages:
- Search result analysis supports multiple languages/regions
- ChatGPT Search may have limited coverage for non-English queries
- Competitor crawling works universally

For best results, use English keywords. We're working on expanding language support.

### How often should I regenerate briefs for the same keyword?

**For evergreen content**: Regenerate briefs every **3-6 months**. Search results evolve as new content ranks and Google's algorithms change.

**For trending topics**: Regenerate briefs **monthly** or when you notice SERP changes (new competitors, AI Overviews appearing/disappearing).

**For time-sensitive content**: Regenerate briefs **before major updates** to ensure your content reflects current competitive landscape.

This keeps your content strategy data-driven and responsive to search trends.

### Can I save or bookmark briefs for later reference?

Yes! All generated briefs are automatically saved to your project. Access them anytime from the **Content Brief Creator** section. You can:
- View past briefs
- Export again in different formats
- Compare briefs over time to see how SERPs evolved

Briefs stay in your project permanently unless manually deleted.
