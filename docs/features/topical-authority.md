# How to Build Topical Authority in Hi, Moose

## What this helps you do

Analyze and improve your website's **topical authority**—how comprehensively and credibly your site covers a specific topic. Hi, Moose's Topic Authority Builder:

- **Scans your entire domain** to discover all pages related to a topic
- **Scores your topical coverage** from 0-100 based on depth, breadth, and relevance
- **Identifies topic clusters** showing which subtopics you cover well (and which you don't)
- **Reveals content gaps** where you're missing key subtopics competitors address
- **Recommends specific actions** prioritized by impact (high, medium, low)
- **Analyzes individual pages** to see how well each contributes to your topical authority
- **Compares your coverage** to what search engines expect for comprehensive topic coverage

**Why topical authority matters**: Search engines (and AI systems) favor sites that demonstrate expertise across an entire topic, not just individual keywords. Building topical authority means creating interconnected content that covers a subject comprehensively, signaling to search engines that you're an authoritative source.

## When to use this

- **Planning content strategies** for a core topic you want to dominate
- **Identifying content gaps** before competitors fill them
- **Auditing existing content** to see how well you cover a topic
- **Improving search rankings** by demonstrating comprehensive topical coverage
- **Before launching new content hubs** to understand current baseline
- **Diagnosing why you rank for some keywords but not others** in a topic area
- **Prioritizing content creation** by discovering high-impact gaps
- **Competitive analysis** to understand how thoroughly competitors cover topics

---

## Before you start

### Requirements
- A Hi, Moose project (any plan)
- Your **domain** (e.g., "example.com")
- A **main topic** to analyze (e.g., "email marketing," "organic gardening," "project management software")
- **Optional**: Related subtopics to include in analysis (e.g., for "email marketing": "automation," "segmentation," "A/B testing")

### How Analysis Works
Hi, Moose:
1. Scans your domain to find all publicly accessible pages
2. Analyzes each page's content to determine if it relates to your main topic
3. Groups related pages into **topic clusters** (subtopic categories)
4. Compares your coverage to comprehensive topic models
5. Identifies **content gaps** where key subtopics are missing or underdeveloped
6. Generates an **overall authority score** and **prioritized recommendations**

### Scan Depth Options
- **Quick**: Analyzes top-level pages (faster, good for initial audits)
- **Medium**: Balanced scan depth (recommended for most sites)
- **Deep**: Comprehensive scan including deeper site sections (slower, most thorough)

### What Gets Analyzed
- Blog posts, articles, guides
- Product/service pages
- Landing pages
- Resource pages
- Any publicly accessible content on your domain

**Not analyzed**: Login-protected pages, dynamic content requiring authentication, non-text content (videos, PDFs) unless text is extractable.

## Step-by-step (in Hi, Moose)

### Part 1: Domain-Wide Topical Analysis

#### 1. Navigate to Topic Authority Builder
- From your project dashboard, select **Topic Authority Builder** from the sidebar
- You'll see the **Topic Authority Analyzer** tab

#### 2. Enter Your Domain
- In the **Domain** field, enter your website domain
- Examples: `example.com`, `blog.example.com`, `www.example.com`
- Hi, Moose normalizes domains automatically (removes protocols, trailing slashes)

**Validation**:
- ✅ **Green checkmark**: Domain format is valid
- ❌ **Red exclamation**: Invalid format—check for typos

**Domain tips**:
- Include subdomains if analyzing a specific section (e.g., `blog.example.com`)
- Don't include paths (e.g., use `example.com` not `example.com/blog`)
- If you paste a full URL, Hi, Moose will prompt you to use just the domain

#### 3. Enter Your Main Topic
- In the **Main Topic** field, enter the primary topic you want to analyze
- Be specific but not too narrow:
  - ✅ "email marketing automation"
  - ✅ "organic vegetable gardening"
  - ❌ "marketing" (too broad)
  - ❌ "Mailchimp automation workflows" (too narrow)

**Why this matters**: The main topic defines what content Hi, Moose looks for. Specific topics yield better insights than vague ones.

#### 4. Add Related Subtopics (Optional)
- In the **Related Subtopics** field, enter comma-separated subtopics
- Example for "email marketing automation":
  - `drip campaigns, lead nurturing, behavioral triggers, segmentation, analytics`
- Leave blank if you want Hi, Moose to discover subtopics automatically

**Pro tip**: Adding related subtopics helps Hi, Moose find nuanced content that might not mention the main topic explicitly.

#### 5. Select Scan Depth
Choose your scan depth based on site size and time available:

**Quick**:
- Scans top-level pages and primary navigation
- Best for: Small sites (< 50 pages), initial quick audits
- Time: 1-2 minutes

**Medium** (Recommended):
- Balanced scan of main sections and deeper pages
- Best for: Most sites, standard audits
- Time: 2-4 minutes

**Deep**:
- Comprehensive scan including nested sections
- Best for: Large sites, in-depth analysis, competitive research
- Time: 4-5 minutes

#### 6. Start the Scan
- Click **"Scan for Topic Authority"**
- You'll see progress:
  - "Scanning index of [your domain] for '[topic]' content..."
  - Progress percentage updates in real-time
  - Deep scans may take up to 5 minutes

**What's happening**: Hi, Moose is crawling your domain, extracting content, analyzing relevance to your topic, and categorizing pages into topic clusters.

#### 7. Review Your Authority Score
Once complete, you'll see:

**Overall Topical Authority Score** (0-100):
- **80-100**: Excellent Authority—comprehensive coverage, strong clustering
- **60-79**: Good Authority—solid foundation, some gaps to fill
- **0-59**: Needs Improvement—significant content gaps, weak topical depth

**Score interpretation**:
- **90+**: You're likely ranking well for most keywords in this topic
- **70-89**: You have authority but competitors may outrank you on subtopics
- **Below 70**: Major opportunities to build content and improve rankings

#### 8. Review Key Metrics
You'll see three key metrics:

**Pages Analyzed**:
- Total number of pages on your domain related to this topic
- More pages ≠ better score—quality and coverage matter more than quantity

**Topic Clusters**:
- Number of distinct subtopic categories your content covers
- Each cluster represents a group of related pages addressing a specific subtopic
- More clusters = broader topical coverage

**Content Gaps**:
- Number of important subtopics you're NOT covering (or covering poorly)
- These are opportunities to create new content and improve authority

#### 9. Review Recommended Actions
Hi, Moose provides **prioritized action items**:

**High Priority** (red):
- Most impactful gaps to fill
- Critical subtopics competitors cover but you don't
- Fix these first for maximum SEO impact

**Medium Priority** (yellow):
- Important improvements for comprehensive coverage
- Strengthen existing thin content

**Low Priority** (blue):
- Nice-to-have additions
- Advanced subtopics for completeness

Each action includes:
- **What to do** (e.g., "Create content about email segmentation strategies")
- **Why it matters** (e.g., "This subtopic is covered by 8/10 competitors but missing from your site")

### Part 2: Topic Cluster Analysis

#### 10. Navigate to the Topics Tab
Click the **"Topics"** tab to see detailed cluster analysis.

**What you'll see**:
- List of all topic clusters your content covers
- Coverage percentage for each cluster
- Number of pages in each cluster
- Related pages grouped by subtopic

**Coverage scoring**:
- **80-100%** (green): Excellent coverage—you have comprehensive content on this subtopic
- **60-79%** (yellow): Average coverage—you address this subtopic but could expand
- **0-59%** (red): Poor coverage—major opportunity to create content

#### 11. Explore Each Topic Cluster
Click any cluster to expand and see:
- **Pages in this cluster**: URLs and titles of pages covering this subtopic
- **Coverage assessment**: What you're doing well and what's missing
- **Suggestions**: Specific content ideas to improve coverage

#### 12. Analyze Individual Pages
For any page in a cluster:
- Click **"Analyze This Page"** to see how well that specific page contributes to topical authority
- This opens the **Page Optimizer** (see Part 3 below)

### Part 3: Content Gaps Analysis

#### 13. Navigate to the Gaps Tab
Click the **"Gaps"** tab to see missing or underdeveloped subtopics.

**What you'll see**:
- List of subtopics you should cover but don't (or barely do)
- Why each gap matters (competitive context, search demand, topical completeness)
- Priority level (high/medium/low)

#### 14. Prioritize Gap-Filling Content
For each gap:
- **High-priority gaps**: Create content immediately—competitors cover these, and they're central to the topic
- **Medium-priority gaps**: Add to content calendar for next quarter
- **Low-priority gaps**: Nice-to-haves for advanced/comprehensive guides

### Part 4: Single Page Topical Analysis

#### 15. Navigate to Page Optimizer Tab
Click the **"Page Optimizer"** tab to analyze how well a specific page contributes to your topical authority.

**Two ways to start**:
1. **From topic clusters**: Click "Analyze This Page" on any page in your cluster view
2. **Manually enter URL**: Analyze any page on your domain

#### 16. Select a Previous Analysis (or Enter New Context)
If you've already run a domain-wide analysis:
- **Select from dropdown**: Choose from previous topic analyses
- Hi, Moose auto-fills domain, topic, and authority score

If this is your first page analysis:
- You'll see: "Run a domain-wide analysis first to use Page Optimizer"
- Or manually enter domain, topic, and a baseline authority score (if you know it from other tools)

#### 17. Enter the Page URL
- Paste the full URL of the page to analyze
- Example: `https://example.com/blog/email-automation-guide`
- Click **"Analyze URL"**

**Domain validation**: Hi, Moose checks that the URL matches the domain from your analysis. If not, you'll see an error.

#### 18. Review Page-Level Analysis
You'll see:

**Page Authority Score** (0-100):
- How well this individual page contributes to your overall topical authority
- Based on: content depth, keyword relevance, internal linking, topic alignment

**Page Assessment**:
- **Strengths**: What this page does well (e.g., "Covers email segmentation comprehensively")
- **Weaknesses**: What's missing or thin (e.g., "Lacks discussion of behavioral triggers")
- **Opportunities**: Specific ways to improve (e.g., "Add section on advanced segmentation techniques")

**Recommended Improvements**:
- Prioritized list of content additions, updates, or restructuring
- Each recommendation tied to improving topical authority

## Tips for best results

- **Be specific with your main topic**: "Content marketing strategies for SaaS" > "marketing"
- **Run deep scans for large sites**: More thorough analysis reveals hidden content
- **Focus on high-priority gaps first**: These have the biggest SEO impact
- **Create comprehensive pillar content**: One strong 3,000+ word guide per cluster > multiple thin posts
- **Interlink cluster pages**: Connect related content to strengthen topical signals
- **Re-analyze quarterly**: Track authority improvements after publishing new content
- **Use Page Optimizer on new content**: Check if new pages strengthen your authority before publishing
- **Compare competitor domains**: Run analyses on competitor sites to see their topical coverage strategy
- **Address gaps before creating more content**: Filling gaps improves authority more than expanding already-strong clusters
- **Include related subtopics**: Helps Hi, Moose find nuanced content that might be missed
- **Analyze subdomains separately**: If you have `blog.example.com`, run a separate analysis for it
- **Export analysis to your team**: Use results to prioritize content calendar and assign writing projects

## Troubleshooting

### "Please enter a valid domain (e.g. example.com)"
**Cause**: Domain format is incorrect.  
**Common issues**:
- Including paths: `example.com/blog` ❌ → Use `example.com` ✅
- Typos or missing TLD: `examplecom` ❌ → Use `example.com` ✅
- Invalid characters

**Solution**: Enter just the domain (and subdomain if needed), no paths or protocols.

### Scan stuck at "Scanning index..." for over 5 minutes
**Cause**: Large site, deep scan selected, or temporary network issues.  
**Solutions**:
- **Wait up to 10 minutes** for deep scans on large sites (500+ pages)
- **Refresh the page** if stuck beyond 10 minutes—analysis may have completed but not updated
- **Try a Medium scan** instead of Deep for faster results
- **Check domain is publicly accessible**—Hi, Moose can't scan password-protected sites

### Authority score is lower than expected even though you have lots of content
**Common reasons**:
- **Content isn't focused on the topic**: Pages mention the topic tangentially but don't deeply address it
- **Thin content**: Many short pages vs. fewer comprehensive guides
- **Missing key subtopics**: Competitors cover important angles you don't
- **No topic clusters**: Content doesn't group into coherent subtopic categories

**Solution**: Focus on **depth over breadth**. Create comprehensive content addressing specific subtopics fully rather than many shallow pages.

### "No pages found related to this topic"
**Cause**: Hi, Moose couldn't find any content on your domain related to your main topic.  
**Common issues**:
- **Topic too narrow**: "Mailchimp automation workflows for e-commerce" → Try "email automation"
- **Topic mismatch**: Analyzing wrong domain or topic not actually covered
- **New site**: Very new domains may not have been crawled yet

**Solutions**:
- **Broaden your main topic** slightly
- **Check you entered the correct domain**
- **Verify your site has content** on this topic (manual check)
- **Try a different topic** you know you cover

### Topic clusters show low coverage (under 60%) across the board
**Cause**: Your content touches many subtopics but doesn't comprehensively address any of them.  
**This means**: You have "thin" topical coverage—lots of breadth, little depth.

**Solution**:
- **Pick 2-3 high-priority clusters** from your results
- **Create comprehensive pillar content** for each (2,000-4,000 words)
- **Interlink related pages** within each cluster
- **Re-analyze in 2-4 weeks** after publishing to see score improvements

### Content gaps list is empty
**Two scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Your score is 90+**  
**Meaning**: You have excellent topical coverage—there are no significant gaps!  
**Action**: Maintain and update existing content. Focus on other topics where you have lower authority.

**Scenario 2: Your score is below 80 but no gaps listed**  
**Cause**: Your existing content is thin across the board rather than missing subtopics.  
**Solution**: **Expand existing pages** rather than create new ones. Check "Recommended Actions" for specific content improvement suggestions.

### "The URL must be from the same domain as your analysis: example.com"
**Cause**: Trying to analyze a page from a different domain than your topical analysis.  
**Why**: Page Optimizer compares a page's authority to your domain's overall authority score—mixing domains would produce meaningless results.

**Solution**:
- **Check for typos** in the URL
- **Use the correct domain**: If analyzing `blog.example.com`, ensure the page is from that subdomain
- **Run a new domain-wide analysis** if you want to analyze a page from a different domain

### Page Optimizer says "Could not extract content from this URL"
**Cause**: Hi, Moose couldn't scrape the page content.  
**Common issues**:
- Page is password-protected or behind a login
- Page uses heavy JavaScript rendering
- Page returns an error (404, 500, etc.)
- Firewall/bot detection blocking automated access

**Solutions**:
- **Verify the URL loads** in your browser
- **Check for access restrictions** (login walls, paywalls)
- **Use manual content input**: Copy the page content and paste it into the "Manual Content Input" field
- **Try a different page** from your domain

## FAQs

### How is topical authority different from keyword rankings?

**Keyword rankings** measure how well you rank for specific search terms (e.g., "email marketing automation").

**Topical authority** measures how comprehensively your entire site covers a broad topic (e.g., the full landscape of email marketing—automation, segmentation, analytics, deliverability, compliance, etc.).

**Why authority matters**: Search engines increasingly favor sites with **topical authority**. Even if you rank well for one keyword, you may struggle to rank for related keywords if your overall topical coverage is weak. Building authority helps you rank for hundreds of related keywords, not just a few.

### What's a "topic cluster" and why does it matter?

A **topic cluster** is a group of pages on your site that all address the same subtopic within your main topic.

**Example**: For the main topic "email marketing," clusters might be:
- Automation cluster (pages about workflows, drip campaigns, triggers)
- Segmentation cluster (pages about list segmentation, targeting, personalization)
- Analytics cluster (pages about open rates, A/B testing, reporting)

**Why clusters matter**: Search engines recognize when related content is grouped and interlinked. Strong clusters signal expertise in that subtopic, improving rankings for all keywords within that cluster.

### Should I create new content or improve existing content?

**Check your Content Gaps**:
- **Many high-priority gaps**: Create new content to fill missing subtopics
- **Few/no gaps but low coverage scores**: Improve existing content—make it more comprehensive

**General rule**: Fill critical gaps first, then improve existing pages. Creating new content for already-covered subtopics dilutes authority; filling gaps expands it.

### How often should I re-analyze topical authority?

**After major content additions**: Re-analyze 2-4 weeks after publishing new content to see authority improvements.

**Quarterly audits**: Run analyses every 3 months to track long-term trends.

**When rankings drop**: If you notice ranking declines in a topic area, run an analysis to check if competitors improved their authority.

### Can I analyze a competitor's domain?

**Yes!** Enter any public domain to analyze their topical authority. Use this for:
- **Competitive benchmarking**: See how your authority compares
- **Content gap analysis**: Discover subtopics competitors cover that you don't
- **Strategy insights**: Understand how leaders in your niche structure topical coverage

**Ethics note**: Use competitor analysis for strategy and learning, not to copy content.

### What authority score should I aim for?

**80+**: Excellent—you're competitive with top sites in this topic  
**70-79**: Good—you have authority but can improve  
**60-69**: Decent—building authority, more work needed  
**Below 60**: Significant opportunity—prioritize content creation

**Context matters**: A score of 70 in a highly competitive niche (e.g., "SEO," "weight loss") may be strong. The same score in a narrow niche (e.g., "pottery glazing techniques") might be average.

### Does topical authority affect AI search visibility?

**Yes**. AI engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) favor **comprehensive, authoritative sources** when generating responses. Sites with high topical authority are more likely to:
- Be cited in AI-generated answers
- Appear in AI search results
- Be recommended as sources

Building topical authority helps with both traditional SEO and AI Engine Optimization (AEO).

### Why does my blog score lower than my main domain?

If you analyzed `blog.example.com` separately from `example.com`, they're scored independently. **Subdomains are treated as separate sites** by search engines.

**Solution**: If your blog is a subdomain, run separate analyses. If it's a subfolder (`example.com/blog`), analyze the main domain—the scan will include blog pages.

### Can I use Page Optimizer without running a domain analysis first?

**Technically yes**, but **not recommended**. Page Optimizer compares a page's authority score to your domain's overall authority. Without a domain analysis:
- You won't have a baseline authority score
- Recommendations will be less specific
- You can't see how the page fits into your cluster strategy

**Best practice**: Run domain analysis first, then use Page Optimizer to refine individual pages.

### What if I disagree with the authority score?

Topical authority scoring is **algorithmic and data-driven**, but not perfect. If your score seems off:
- **Check if your main topic matches your content**: A mismatch (e.g., analyzing "SEO" when you primarily cover "content marketing") produces inaccurate scores
- **Review content gaps**: Even if you *think* you cover a topic well, gaps may reveal missing angles
- **Focus on recommendations, not just the score**: Actionable insights matter more than the number

### How long does it take to improve topical authority?

**Quick wins (4-8 weeks)**:
- Publish 2-3 high-priority gap-filling posts
- Improve internal linking between cluster pages
- Re-analyze to see 5-15 point score increase

**Long-term authority building (6-12 months)**:
- Consistently publish comprehensive content
- Build backlinks to cluster pages
- Update and expand existing content
- Expect 20-40+ point score increases

**Topical authority is cumulative**: Every piece of quality content adds to your authority. The more you publish, the faster you build momentum.
