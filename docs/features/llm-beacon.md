# How to Monitor Brand Visibility in AI Engines in Hi, Moose

## What this helps you do

Track how your brand appears across various LLMs and AI chat when people ask questions in your industry. Hi, Moose's LLM Beacon monitors:

- **Google AI Overview**: See if your content appears in Google's AI-generated answer boxes
- **ChatGPT**: Track mentions in ChatGPT's conversational responses
- **Claude**: Monitor your brand in Claude's answers
- **Perplexity**: Check if Perplexity cites your content
- **Gemini**: Track visibility in Google's Gemini AI
- **Grok**: Monitor mentions in X's AI assistant

Unlike traditional SEO tracking, LLM Beacon shows you **how AI systems respond** when users ask natural language questions. You'll see:

- **If your brand is mentioned** (domain or brand name appears)
- **If your content is cited** (AI includes URLs to your site)
- **What context surrounds your mentions** (full AI-generated responses)
- **Who your competitors are** (other brands cited in the same responses)
- **Weekly automated checks** so you can track changes over time

---

## When to use this

- **Monitoring brand awareness in AI search**: See if AI engines know about your brand
- **Tracking competitive positioning**: Discover which competitors AI systems cite alongside you
- **Identifying visibility gaps**: Find queries where you should be mentioned but aren't
- **Measuring content impact**: See if your content strategy improves AI visibility over time
- **Auditing AI search presence**: Understand your baseline visibility before launching campaigns
- **Tracking thought leadership**: Monitor if AI cites you as an authority in your niche
- **Competitive intelligence**: Discover what prompts trigger competitor mentions

## Before you start

### Requirements
- A paid Hi, Moose subscription
- **Brand information configured** in your project:
  - Brand name (e.g., "Acme Industries")
  - Domain (e.g., "acmeindustries.com")
  - Set this up in **Brand Voice** settings before adding prompts

### How Credits Work
- Each **platform you track = 1 credit**
- Example: Tracking 1 prompt across 3 platforms (AI Overview, ChatGPT, Claude) = 3 credits
- Credits do not accrue, tracking a prompt uses a credit, removing a prompt returns the credit:
- **Weekly automatic checks**: Once added, prompts are checked automatically every week

### Free Plan Limitations
LLM Beacon is **not available on Free plans**. This is a premium feature requiring paid subscriptions.

## Step-by-step (in Hi, Moose)

### 1. Navigate to LLM Beacon
- From your project dashboard, select **LLM Beacon** from the sidebar
- You'll see the Tracked Prompts overview

### 2. Configure Brand Information (First Time Only)
If you haven't set up your brand info yet:
- Click **"Add a New Prompt"**
- You'll see a prompt to configure your brand information
- Enter your **Brand Name** (e.g., "Acme Industries")
- Enter your **Domain** (e.g., "acmeindustries.com" or "https://www.acmeindustries.com")
  - Hi, Moose automatically normalizes domains (removes www, https://, trailing slashes)
- Click **"Save Brand Info"**

**Why this matters**: Hi, Moose uses your brand name and domain to detect mentions and citations across AI platforms. This is stored in your Brand Voice settings and used for all tracking prompts.

### 3. Add a Prompt to Track
Click **"Add a New Prompt"** (or **"Add Your First Prompt"** if this is your first one).

**In the Add Prompt modal:**

**a) Review Your Brand**
- Confirm your brand name and domain are correct
- Click **"Edit"** if you need to change them

**b) Enter Your Prompt**
- In the **"Prompt to Track"** field, enter a natural language query (up to 500 characters)
- Write it **as a real person would ask**, not as SEO keywords

**Important**: AI typically will respond with a new or variation of a response when you use the same prompt repeatedly. For the data from LLM Beacon to be helpful, think of tracking your brand across LLMs in terms of topics. So, if you track several prompts that you consider high-value (what your customer will use), we strongly suggest tracking several variants of these prompts for a single topic. With several prompts used per topic, you can start to determine if your brand is surfacing for the topic you care about. LLM Beacon will serve as a jumping off point on where to take action.

- Prompt Examples to Track by Topic:

1. "What is email marketing?"
2. "What is email marketing automation and how does it work?" 
3. "Best email marketing platforms for small businesses"
4. "Which email tools have the best A/B testing capabilities?"
5. "What are the top alternatives to Mailchimp?"
6. "Most affordable email marketing software SMB"

**c) Select Platforms to Track**
- Check the boxes for platforms you want to monitor:
  - **AI Overview** (Google's AI-generated answers)
  - **ChatGPT** (OpenAI's chatbot)
  - **Claude** (Anthropic's AI assistant)
  - **Perplexity** (AI-powered search engine)
  - **Gemini** (Google's AI chatbot / AI Mode uses Gemini)
  - **Grok** (X's AI assistant)
- Each platform uses **1 credit**
- You'll see: **"You have X credits remaining"**

**Pro tip**: Start with 2-3 platforms to conserve credits. AI Overview, Gemini, and ChatGPT are the most popular, so prioritize those.

**d) Add the Prompt**
- Click **"Add Prompt"**
- Hi, Moose will:
  1. Create the tracking prompt
  2. Run an **initial check immediately** (results in 1-3 minutes)
  3. Schedule **weekly automatic checks** going forward (these are auto scheduled)
- You'll see: "Prompt added and initial check has started. Results may take a few minutes."

### 4. View Your Tracked Prompts
Back on the main LLM Beacon page, you'll see:
- **Tracked Prompts count** (e.g., "Tracked Prompts (3)")
- **Credit usage** displayed at the top
- **List of your prompts** with:
  - The prompt text
  - Platforms being tracked (with status icons)
  - Last checked date
  - Expand/collapse controls

### 5. Check Initial Results
Within 1-3 minutes, your initial check completes. For each platform, you'll see one of these statuses:

**Status Icons:**
- **Spinning icon** (blue): Check in progress
- **Green checkmark**: Your brand was mentioned or cited
- **Red X**: Not mentioned
- **Yellow info icon** (AI Overview only): No AI Overview exists for this query (this is normal—not all queries trigger AI Overviews)
- **Gray dash**: No results yet

### 6. View Detailed Results
Click a platform icon to expand details:

**For prompts where you're mentioned/cited:**
- **Your mention/citation**: Shows the context where your brand appears, with your domain and brand name highlighted
- **Timestamp**: When the check ran
- **Full AI response**: The complete answer the AI provided
- **Competitors cited**: Other brands/domains mentioned in the same response

**For prompts where you're NOT mentioned:**

- **Full AI response**: The complete answer (so you can see what content/angle is preferred)

### 7. Analyze Competitive Intelligence
Scroll down to see **"Competitors Also Mentioned"**:
- Lists all other domains/brands cited by the AI
- See who your competitors are in AI search results
- Identify gaps where you should be mentioned but aren't

### 8. Monitor Weekly Automated Checks
Once added, prompts are checked **automatically every week**:
- Hi, Moose distributes checks throughout the week
- You don't need to do anything—just check back periodically
- **Last Checked** timestamp shows when the most recent check ran

### 9. Delete Prompts
To stop tracking a prompt and reclaim credits:
- Click the **trash icon** on any prompt card
- Confirm deletion
- Credits are freed up immediately for reuse

**Note**: Deleting a prompt does **not** recover already-used monthly credits—it only stops future weekly checks and frees up your tracking slots.

## Tips for best results

- **Think of LLM tracking as Topic Tracking**: Write queries as real people ask them, try to avoid using a query to broad like "dogs"
- **Track buyer-intent queries**: Focus on prompts potential customers would use when researching solutions
- **Start with 2-3 platforms**: Conserve credits by tracking the most important platforms (AI Overview, Gemini, ChatGPT)
- **Check competitors' prompts**: Add prompts where competitors are mentioned to understand their AI visibility strategy
- **Publish content addressing the query topic**: If you're not mentioned, use the Hi, Moose AEO tools, Topic Authority Generator, Podcast Generator, FAQs, and Key Points, to optimize content for better AI visibility
- **Run on-demand checks after publishing**: Published new content? Run a fresh check to see if AI picked it up
- **Monitor weekly for trends**: Watch how visibility changes over weeks—this shows if your content strategy is working
- **Study competitor citations**: See who's being mentioned and analyze their content to identify winning strategies
- **Consider off-site optimization**: Not currently supported on Hi, Moose. LLMs often cite user-generated content sites like StackOverflow, Reddit, Forums, YouTube, etc. Explore ways you can add to the conversation on these platforms, do not spam, but add meaningful contributions. If there is a natural place to introduce your brand, do so transparently and honestly. Make sure to follow the community guidelines to avoid the ban hammer. 

Another opportunity may exist on reviews like G2, Capttera, and TrustPilot. These are great sources for third-party validation that LLMs often cite.

Also, look for affiliate sites that have published "best of" listicles. Depending on the site, these are sometimes cited heavily and potentially a great opportunity for LLM inclusion. As you use LLM Beacon, look at the domains that are being cited to determine if there may be partnership opportunities.

## Troubleshooting

### "You only have X credits remaining. Each platform requires 1 credit."
**Cause**: You're trying to track more platforms than you have credits for.  
**Solution**: 
- Uncheck some platforms to reduce credit usage
- Or delete existing prompts to free up credits
- Or upgrade your plan for more monthly credits

### "LLM Beacon tracking is a premium feature available on paid plans"
**Cause**: You're on a Free plan.  
**Solution**: Upgrade to Starter, Growth, or Enterprise to access LLM Beacon. Click **"View Plans & Pricing"** to see options.

### "Please configure your brand information first"
**Cause**: You haven't set up brand name and domain.  
**Solution**: 
- The modal will prompt you automatically
- Enter your brand name and domain
- Or visit **Brand Voice** settings to configure it manually
- Save and return to add your prompt

### Initial check stuck on "in progress" (spinning icon)
**Cause**: Checks typically take 1-3 minutes, but can occasionally take up to 5 minutes for complex queries.  
**Solution**: 
- Wait up to 5 minutes
- Refresh the page to see if results loaded
- If still stuck after 10 minutes, click the refresh icon to re-run the check

### Weekly checks not running automatically
**Cause**: Hi, Moose schedules checks throughout the week. Your prompt may not be due yet.  
**Solution**: 
- Check the **"Last Checked"** timestamp—weekly means every 7 days from that date
- Run an **on-demand check** if you need immediate results (click the refresh icon)
- If no checks have run for 10+ days, contact support@himoose.com

### Yellow info icon on AI Overview says "No AI Overview found"
**Explanation**: This is **not an error**. Google doesn't show AI Overviews for all queries. They typically appear for:
- Informational queries (how-to, what is)
- Complex topics
- Questions with nuanced answers

**Action**: This is normal. Your prompt may not trigger an AI Overview. You can:
- Still track other platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Focus on platforms that DO return results

### Prompt deleted accidentally
**Cause**: Prompts are permanently deleted when you click the trash icon and confirm.  
**Solution**: 
- Re-add the prompt as a new tracking item
- Depending on how much time has passed, historic may be gone permenantly. The system will try to recover historic data, but it may not be available.

### "Check completed successfully" but no results appear
**Cause**: Browser timeout while waiting for results, but the check is still processing in the background.  
**Solution**: 
- Refresh the page after 1-2 minutes
- Results save automatically even if your browser times out
- If still no results after 5 minutes, run another on-demand check

## FAQs

### How does Hi, Moose detect my brand?

Hi, Moose searches AI responses for:
- **Your domain** (e.g., "acmeindustries.com")—normalized to match with or without www, https://, etc.
- **Your brand name** (e.g., "Acme Industries")—case-insensitive matching

If either appears in the AI's response, we flag it as "mentioned." If a URL to your domain appears, we flag it as "cited."

### What's the difference between "mentioned" and "cited"?

**Mentioned**: Your brand name or domain appears in the AI's text response (e.g., "Acme Industries offers great software").

**Cited**: The AI includes a clickable URL to your website (e.g., "Check out acmeindustries.com/pricing").

**Best case**: Both mentioned AND cited—your brand is named and linked.

### Why do weekly checks matter?

AI models update constantly, and your visibility changes as:
- LLMs are fundamentally probabilistic, meaning they generate responses by predicting the most likely next word (token) based on patterns in training data. This core probability is why the same prompts can yield different responses.
- New content is published (yours and competitors')
- AI models retrain on fresh data
- Competitors gain or lose citations

Weekly tracking shows **trends over time**, helping you measure if your content strategy improves AI visibility at a topic level with enough variations of prompt targeting the same topic.

### Can I track more than one brand?

Each Hi, Moose project tracks **one brand** (configured in Brand Voice settings). To track multiple brands:
- Create separate projects for each brand
- Configure unique brand names/domains per project
- Credits are per-project

### Why don't AI engines mention me even though I have great content?

Common reasons:
- **Content is too new**: AI hasn't seen it
- **Low domain and topic authority**: AI favors established, trusted domains
- **Content doesn't directly answer the query**: AI extracts clear, concise answers—vague or tangential content is often skipped
- **Competitors have stronger signals**: More domain and topical authority, optimized for extractability, and backlinks and mentions (with or without the link) across various domains with high authority

**Solution**: Focus on direct answers, build authority, and give search engines and AI time to learn about and train on your content.

### Can I change the platforms I'm tracking for an existing prompt?

**Not currently**. To track different platforms:
- Re-add the prompt with new platform selections
- You can delete the previous prompt, but you will lose the historic data

### How accurate are the results?

Results reflect **what AI engines actually return** when queried. Accuracy factors:
- AI models can use or prioritize different data sources and training
- LLMs can use different search engines to make fan-out queries and ground responses
- Results can vary by geography, language, and user-specific context
