# How to Monitor Brand Visibility in AI Engines in Hi, Moose

## What this helps you do

Track how your brand appears across **AI-powered search engines and chatbots** when people ask questions in your industry. Hi, Moose's LLM Beacon monitors:

- **Google AI Overview**: See if your content appears in Google's AI-generated answer boxes
- **ChatGPT**: Track mentions in ChatGPT's conversational responses
- **Claude**: Monitor your brand in Claude's answers
- **Perplexity**: Check if Perplexity cites your content
- **Gemini**: Track visibility in Google's Gemini AI
- **Grok**: Monitor mentions in X's AI assistant

Unlike traditional SEO tracking, LLM Beacon shows you **how AI systems respond** when users ask natural language questions. You'll see:

- **If your brand is mentioned** (domain or brand name appears)
- **If your content is cited** (AI includes URLs to your site)
- **What context surrounds your mentions** (full AI-generated responses)
- **Who your competitors are** (other brands cited in the same responses)
- **Weekly automated checks** so you can track changes over time

This matters because AI-powered search is rapidly replacing traditional Google searches. If AI engines don't mention or cite your brand, you're invisible to a growing segment of searchers.

## Step-by-step (in Hi, Moose)

### 1. Navigate to LLM Beacon
- From your project dashboard, select **LLM Beacon** from the sidebar
- You'll see the Tracked Prompts overview

### 2. Configure Brand Information (First Time Only)
If you haven't set up your brand info yet:
- Click **"Add a New Prompt"**
- You'll see a prompt to configure your brand information
- Enter your **Brand Name** (e.g., "Acme Industries")
- Enter your **Domain** (e.g., "acmeindustries.com" or "https://www.acmeindustries.com")
  - Hi, Moose automatically normalizes domains (removes www, https://, trailing slashes)
- Click **"Save Brand Info"**

**Why this matters**: Hi, Moose uses your brand name and domain to detect mentions and citations across AI platforms. This is stored in your Brand Voice settings and used for all tracking prompts.

**Pro tip**: You can update brand info anytime by clicking **"Edit"** next to your brand name in the Add Prompt modal, or by visiting **Brand Voice** settings.

### 3. Add a Prompt to Track
Click **"Add a New Prompt"** (or **"Add Your First Prompt"** if this is your first one).

**In the Add Prompt modal:**

**a) Review Your Brand**
- Confirm your brand name and domain are correct
- Click **"Edit"** if you need to change them

**b) Enter Your Prompt**
- In the **"Prompt to Track"** field, enter a natural language query (up to 500 characters)
- Write it **as a real person would ask**, not as SEO keywords
- Examples:
  - ✅ "Find the best organic potting soil for starting raised vegetable beds this spring"
  - ✅ "What are the top project management tools for remote teams?"
  - ❌ "best potting soil" (too short/generic)
  - ❌ "organic gardening SEO keywords" (not natural language)

**Why natural language matters**: AI engines respond to conversational queries. Your prompts should mirror how real users ask questions.

**c) Select Platforms to Track**
- Check the boxes for platforms you want to monitor:
  - **AI Overview** (Google's AI-generated answers)
  - **ChatGPT** (OpenAI's chatbot)
  - **Claude** (Anthropic's AI assistant)
  - **Perplexity** (AI-powered search engine)
  - **Gemini** (Google's AI chatbot)
  - **Grok** (X's AI assistant)
- Each platform uses **1 credit**
- You'll see: **"You have X credits remaining"**

**Pro tip**: Start with 2-3 platforms to conserve credits. AI Overview and ChatGPT are the most popular, so prioritize those.

**d) Add the Prompt**
- Click **"Add Prompt"**
- Hi, Moose will:
  1. Create the tracking prompt
  2. Run an **initial check immediately** (results in 1-3 minutes)
  3. Schedule **weekly automatic checks** going forward
- You'll see: "Prompt added and initial check has started. Results may take a few minutes."

### 4. View Your Tracked Prompts
Back on the main LLM Beacon page, you'll see:
- **Tracked Prompts count** (e.g., "Tracked Prompts (3)")
- **Credit usage** displayed at the top
- **List of your prompts** with:
  - The prompt text
  - Platforms being tracked (with status icons)
  - Last checked date
  - Expand/collapse controls

### 5. Check Initial Results
Within 1-3 minutes, your initial check completes. For each platform, you'll see one of these statuses:

**Status Icons:**
- **Spinning icon** (blue): Check in progress
- **Green checkmark**: Your brand was mentioned or cited
- **Red X**: Not mentioned
- **Yellow info icon** (AI Overview only): No AI Overview exists for this query (this is normal—not all queries trigger AI Overviews)
- **Gray dash**: No results yet

### 6. View Detailed Results
Click a platform icon to expand details:

**For prompts where you're mentioned/cited:**
- **Your mention/citation**: Shows the context where your brand appears, with your domain and brand name highlighted

**For prompts where you're NOT mentioned:**

- Identify gaps where you should be mentioned but aren't

Want to check a prompt immediately instead of waiting for the weekly schedule?
- Click the **refresh icon** next to any prompt
- Hi, Moose runs a fresh check across all platforms
- Results appear in 1-3 minutes
- **Use this when**: You've published new content and want to see if AI visibility improved

### 9. Monitor Weekly Automated Checks
Once added, prompts are checked **automatically every week**:
- Hi, Moose distributes checks throughout the week to avoid rate limits
- You don't need to do anything—just check back periodically
- **Last Checked** timestamp shows when the most recent check ran

### 10. Delete Prompts
To stop tracking a prompt and reclaim credits:

## Tips for best results

- **Use natural, conversational prompts**: Write queries as real people ask them, not keyword strings
- **Track buyer-intent queries**: Focus on prompts potential customers would use when researching solutions
- **Start with 2-3 platforms**: Conserve credits by tracking the most important platforms (AI Overview, ChatGPT)
- **Check competitors' prompts**: Add prompts where competitors are mentioned to understand their AI visibility strategy
- **Publish content addressing the query**: If you're not mentioned, create comprehensive content directly answering the prompt
- **Include your domain visibly**: AI systems often cite pages with clear branding and URLs
- **Run on-demand checks after publishing**: Published new content? Run a fresh check to see if AI picked it up
- **Monitor weekly for trends**: Watch how visibility changes over weeks—this shows if your content strategy is working
- **Study competitor citations**: See who's being mentioned and analyze their content to identify winning strategies
- **Use specific prompts**: "Best CRM for real estate teams" performs better than generic "CRM software"
- **Leverage AI Overview insights**: If no AI Overview exists, you have less competition from Google's AI
- **Rotate prompts monthly**: Delete low-priority prompts and test new ones to maximize credit usage

## Troubleshooting

### "You only have X credits remaining. Each platform requires 1 credit."
**Cause**: You're trying to track more platforms than you have credits for.  
**Solution**: 
- Uncheck some platforms to reduce credit usage
- Or delete existing prompts to free up credits
- Or upgrade your plan for more monthly credits

### "LLM Beacon tracking is a premium feature available on paid plans"
**Cause**: You're on a Free plan.  
**Solution**: Upgrade to Starter, Growth, or Enterprise to access LLM Beacon. Click **"View Plans & Pricing"** to see options.

### "Please configure your brand information first"
**Cause**: You haven't set up brand name and domain.  
**Solution**: 
- The modal will prompt you automatically
- Enter your brand name and domain
- Or visit **Brand Voice** settings to configure it manually
- Save and return to add your prompt

### Initial check stuck on "in progress" (spinning icon)
**Cause**: Checks typically take 1-3 minutes, but can occasionally take up to 5 minutes for complex queries.  
**Solution**: 
- Wait up to 5 minutes
- Refresh the page to see if results loaded
- If still stuck after 10 minutes, click the refresh icon to re-run the check

### "Not mentioned" result even though you know you have relevant content
**Common reasons**:
- AI systems use cached/outdated data—new content takes weeks to be indexed by AI models
- Your content doesn't directly answer the query in a way AI can extract
- Competitors have stronger authority signals (backlinks, domain age, citations)
- Your domain/brand name isn't prominently featured on the page

**Solutions**:
- Wait 2-4 weeks for AI models to index new content
- Create content that **directly answers** the query in the first paragraph
- Include your brand name and domain visibly in the content
- Build backlinks to increase domain authority
- Use structured data (schema markup) to help AI extract information

### Weekly checks not running automatically
**Cause**: Hi, Moose schedules checks throughout the week to avoid rate limits. Your prompt may not be due yet.  
**Solution**: 
- Check the **"Last Checked"** timestamp—weekly means every 7 days from that date
- Run an **on-demand check** if you need immediate results (click the refresh icon)
- If no checks have run for 10+ days, contact support

### Yellow info icon on AI Overview says "No AI Overview found"
**Explanation**: This is **not an error**. Google doesn't show AI Overviews for all queries. They typically appear for:
- Informational queries (how-to, what is)
- Complex topics
- Questions with nuanced answers

**Action**: This is normal. Your prompt may not trigger an AI Overview. You can:
- Still track other platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Focus on platforms that DO return results
- Consider this a positive—less competition from Google's AI

### Prompt deleted accidentally
**Cause**: Prompts are permanently deleted when you click the trash icon and confirm.  
**Solution**: 
- No recovery option—deleted prompts are gone
- Re-add the prompt as a new tracking item
- Historical results from the deleted prompt are also removed

### "Check completed successfully" but no results appear
**Cause**: Browser timeout while waiting for results, but the check is still processing in the background.  
**Solution**: 
- Refresh the page after 1-2 minutes
- Results save automatically even if your browser times out
- If still no results after 5 minutes, run another on-demand check

## FAQs

### How does Hi, Moose detect my brand?

Hi, Moose searches AI responses for:
- **Your domain** (e.g., "acmeindustries.com")—normalized to match with or without www, https://, etc.
- **Your brand name** (e.g., "Acme Industries")—case-insensitive matching

If either appears in the AI's response, we flag it as "mentioned." If a URL to your domain appears, we flag it as "cited."

### What's the difference between "mentioned" and "cited"?

**Mentioned**: Your brand name or domain appears in the AI's text response (e.g., "Acme Industries offers great software").

**Cited**: The AI includes a clickable URL to your website (e.g., "Check out acmeindustries.com/pricing").

**Best case**: Both mentioned AND cited—your brand is named and linked.

### Why do weekly checks matter?

AI models update constantly, and your visibility changes as:
- New content is published (yours and competitors')
- AI models retrain on fresh data
- Search trends evolve
- Competitors gain or lose citations

Weekly tracking shows **trends over time**, helping you measure if your content strategy improves AI visibility.

### Can I track more than one brand?

Each Hi, Moose project tracks **one brand** (configured in Brand Voice settings). To track multiple brands:
- Create separate projects for each brand
- Configure unique brand names/domains per project
- Credits are per-project

### How long does it take for new content to appear in AI results?

**2-4 weeks** on average. AI models don't index the web in real-time. After publishing:
- Wait 2 weeks minimum before expecting mentions
- Run weekly checks to monitor when AI picks up your content
- Promote your content (backlinks, social shares) to speed up discovery

### Why don't AI engines mention me even though I have great content?

Common reasons:
- **Content is too new**: AI hasn't indexed it yet (wait 2-4 weeks)
- **Low domain authority**: AI favors established, trusted domains
- **Content doesn't directly answer the query**: AI extracts clear, concise answers—vague or tangential content gets skipped
- **Competitors have stronger signals**: More backlinks, better structured data, clearer authority

**Solution**: Focus on direct answers, build authority, and give AI time to index your content.

### Can I change the platforms I'm tracking for an existing prompt?

**Not currently**. To track different platforms:
- Delete the existing prompt (frees credits)
- Re-add the prompt with new platform selections
- Historical results from the deleted prompt will be lost

### What happens if I run out of credits mid-month?

You **cannot add new prompts** until:
- Your monthly credits reset (beginning of next billing cycle)
- You delete existing prompts to free up credits
- You upgrade to a plan with more credits

**Existing prompts continue running** their weekly checks—you just can't add new ones.

### Do on-demand checks use extra credits?

**No**. On-demand checks (clicking the refresh icon) do **not** consume additional credits. You can run them as often as needed. Credits are only used when **adding a new prompt**.

**Rate limits apply**: You can run a few on-demand checks per minute to avoid overload.

### Why is my competitor mentioned but I'm not?

Competitor mentions indicate:
- They have content AI considers authoritative for that query
- Their domain has stronger signals (backlinks, age, citations)
- Their content directly answers the query in a way AI can extract

**Use this as competitive intelligence**:
- Study their cited content
- Identify gaps in your content
- Create better, more comprehensive answers
- Build authority through backlinks and citations

### How accurate are the results?

Results reflect **what AI engines actually return** when queried. Accuracy factors:
- AI models use slightly different data sources and training
- Results can vary by geography, language, and user context
- AI models update regularly, so today's result may differ from tomorrow's

**Hi, Moose shows you real AI responses**—this is what users see when they ask these questions.

### Can I export LLM Beacon results?

Not currently. You can:
- View results in the Hi, Moose dashboard
- Take screenshots for reporting
- Copy full AI responses for analysis

We're working on CSV/PDF export for client reporting.
